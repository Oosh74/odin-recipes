        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h3>
            <p>
              In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until
              browned. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and garlic to
              the skillet and sauté until the onion is translucent. Stir in the
              crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried
              oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let
              it cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Prepare the
              Cheese Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
              grated Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well
              and set aside. Cook the Lasagna Noodles: While the sauce is
              simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package
              instructions. Drain and set aside.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Assemble the Lasagna:</h3>
            <p>
              Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13-inch baking dish,
              spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of lasagna
              noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over
              the noodles. Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over
              the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, cheese
              mixture, mozzarella) until you have used up all the ingredients,
              ending with a layer of sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella
              cheese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Bake the Lasagna:</h3>
            <p>
              Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you
              can spray one side of the foil with cooking spray). Bake in the
              preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
              additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden
              brown. Let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes before
              serving. Serve and Enjoy: Cut into squares and serve with a side
              salad or garlic bread.
