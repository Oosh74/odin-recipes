        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Prepare the beef filling:</h3>
            <p>
              Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef
              and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it begins to brown.
              Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until
              the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
              cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for
              another 2 minutes, allowing the spices to bloom. Add the tomato
              sauce and water to the skillet. Reduce the heat to low and let the
              mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has
              thickened and the beef is fully cooked. Stir occasionally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Heat the tortillas:</h3>
            <p>
              In a separate dry skillet or directly over a gas flame, heat the
              corn tortillas for about 30 seconds on each side, or until they
              are warm and slightly charred. Keep them warm in a clean towel.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Assemble the tacos:</h3>
            <p>
              Spoon some of the beef mixture onto each warm tortilla. Top with
              chopped cilantro and finely chopped onion. Add a squeeze of fresh
              lime juice to each taco. If desired, top with salsa and crumbled
              queso fresco or grated cheese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Serve immediately:</h3>
            <p>
              Serve the tacos hot, accompanied by additional lime wedges and
              your favorite salsa. Enjoy your delicious, simple, and authentic
              tacos!
