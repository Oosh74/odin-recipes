        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Prepare the sushi rice:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs
                clear.
              </li>
              <li>
                Combine the rice and water in a rice cooker and cook according
                to the rice cooker's instructions. Alternatively, bring the
                water and rice to a boil in a pot, reduce the heat to low,
                cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                emove from heat and let it sit covered for 10 minutes. In a
                small saucepan, heat the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt over low
                heat until the sugar and salt dissolve. Do not let it boil.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the
                vinegar mixture. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Assemble the sushi rolls:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Place a bamboo sushi mat on a flat surface and cover it with
                plastic wrap. Place a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the
                mat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wet your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking.
                Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori,
                leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the top edge uncovered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arrange a few slices of cucumber, avocado, and crab sticks
                horizontally across the middle of the rice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi away from you,
                applying gentle pressure to shape the roll. Seal the edge of the
                nori with a little water.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Slice the sushi rolls:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi roll into 6-8 pieces. Wipe
                the knife with a damp cloth between cuts to ensure clean slices.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Arrange the sushi pieces on a plate and serve with soy sauce,
                pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
